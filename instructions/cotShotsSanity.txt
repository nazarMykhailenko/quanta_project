# Example 1

If the Input is this:
"
# Here is the problem statement: 
In 1942 Mr. Dewey was elected a Governor. Now, a few years later, he and his team of politicians want to be reelected. In order to advertise themselves, they said the following: ""When Dewey was elected Governor in 1942 the minimum teacher's salary in some districts was as low as 900 \$ a year. Today the school teachers in New York enjoy the highest salaries in the world, thanks to his policies. As a result of his policies, the minimum yearly salaries of teachers in New York City now range from 2500 \$ to 5325 \$."" What do you think about this statement? Does it prove anything good about Mr. Dewey? (It was an actual campaign statement (part of it) from a Republican Party in October 1948.)

# For which the correct solution(s) are: 
**Answer:** Nope, it does not.

**Solution:** 
Besides this being a speech of a politician, which one must always take with extra caution, it is likely enough that the numbers mentioned are dishonest. But even if those numbers are actually correct, there are a few specific issues with the speech anyway:
1. The speech compares the salary in ""some districts"" to ""New York"", so it is ""comparing apples to oranges"" as politicians love to do.
2. The speech literally does not mean that the situation was worse before. It merely states some numbers about today and an unrelated number about the past. What if, in the past, teachers were getting more than ""from 2500 \$ to 5325 \$.""? It is not clear from this speech they were not.
3. Also, even if the point above is not true, i.e., if the policies did help with the salaries in New York, maybe it was because of the salaries in ""some other district."" Thus, maybe in some districts, people live much worse; it is just that the people in New York earn more (which would make sense if the party was trying to get reelected in New York and hence did not quite care about all of the districts that did not have many votes).

# And the Input Solution that I want you to do a sanity check for is: 
Answer: No.

This statement doesn't really prove anything good about Mr. Dewey. Here are a few reasons why:

- The speech compares teacher salaries in ""some districts"" in 1942 to those in New York City now. This is like comparing apples to oranges; it's not a fair comparison.
- The statement doesn't say that teacher salaries were worse before. It only gives numbers for now and one number from the past. What if teachers in 1942 were already earning more than $2500 to $5325? The speech doesn't make that clear.
- Even if Dewey's policies did help increase salaries in New York, it might be at the expense of salaries in other districts. So, while salaries in New York may have increased, salaries elsewhere might have decreased. The statement only focuses on New York because that's where Dewey wants votes.

Overall, the statement is misleading and doesn't provide enough information to prove Dewey's policies were beneficial overall.

"# Here is the problem statement: 
There are three boxes, each of which contains balls with numbers from 0 to 9. One ball is taken out of each box. What is the probability that three a) identical b) different balls are chosen?

# For which the correct solution(s) are: 
**Answer:** 
a) $10/1000=1 \%$ 
b) $10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 / 1000 = 72\%$.

**Solution**
There are precisely $10^3 = 1000$ different tripples of balls that one could pick, and so the probability model we should consider is the one with 1000 simple corresponding events, all being equally likely.

a) There are precisely 10 different ways of picking three balls that are all identical, namely ""pick all 0"", ""pick all 1"", ..., ""pick all 9"". Thus, the probability of picking three identical balls is $10/1000 = 0.01$.

b) There are precisely $10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 720$ different ways of picking three different balls from the three boxes. Thus, the probability of picking three different balls are $720 / 1000 = 72 \%$.

# And the Input Solution that I want you to do a sanity check for is: 
1) Since \(9 = 3^2\), and there are 3 boxes, and we are also picking 3 balls, the probability of chosing identical balls should be \(\frac{1}{3}\).

If the Input is this:
"# Here is the problem statement: 
On each of 4 cards a distinct natural number is written. If two are picked at random, the probabilities that the sum is less than 9, equal to 9, and more than 9 are all equal. What numbers could be written on the cards?

# For which the correct solution(s) are: 
**Answer:** The possible sets of numbers are: $ (1, 2, 7, 8); (1, 3, 6, 8); (1, 4, 5, 8); (2, 3, 6, 7); (2, 4, 5, 7); (3, 4, 5, 6) $.

**Solution:**

1. Let's consider four cards with natural numbers \(a \leq b \leq c \leq d\). Two cards can be chosen in six different ways. Since any pair of cards is chosen randomly, the probability of choosing a specific pair is \(\frac{1}{6}\). According to the problem statement, the events \(\{s < 9\}\), \(\{s = 9\}\), and \(\{s > 9\}\) (where \(s\) is the sum of the numbers on the chosen cards) are equally likely, so the probability of each is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

2. This implies that among the sums \(a + b\), \(a + c\), \(a + d\), \(b + c\), \(b + d\), and \(c + d\):
- Two sums are equal to 9,
- Two sums are greater than 9,
- Two sums are less than 9.

3. Given the inequalities \(a + b \leq a + c \leq a + d \leq b + d \leq c + d\) and \(a + c \leq b + c \leq b + d\), the sums equal to 9 are \(a + d\) and \(b + c\), the sums less than 9 are \(a + b\) and \(a + c\), and the sums greater than 9 are \(b + d\) and \(c + d\). In particular, since \(a + c < a + d\), it follows that \(c < d\). Similarly, \(a < b\). Additionally, \(b < c\) because the sum \(b + c\) is odd.

4. Therefore,  considering the derived inequalities, the pairs \(\{a, d\}\) and \(\{b, c\}\) must be selected from the pairs \(\{1, 8\}\), \(\{2, 7\}\), \(\{3, 6\}\), \(\{4, 5\}\) (these are the only pairs of positive integers that add up to 9). From this, we get the answer.

# Here is the problem statement: 
Let $(\Omega, \mathbb{P})$ be a finite probability space and assume there are two random variables defined on this probability space, say $X$ and $Y$. Is it necessarily true that $\mathbb{E}[X \cdot Y] = \mathbb{E} [X] \cdot \mathbb{E}[Y]$?

# For which the correct solution(s) are: 
**Answer: ** No, it is not true.

**Solution: ** 
1. As a counterexample to the equality, consider a probability model where
- $\Omega = \{ H, T \} $ (corresponding to the coin flips for example), and 
- $\mathbb{P}(H) = \mathbb{P}(T) = 1/2$. 
- Random Variables $X$ and $Y$ are equal, such that $X(H) = 1, X(T) = -1$ and $Y(H) = 1, Y(T) = -1$.
- Then random variables $XY$ is such that it always takes value $1$ (cause for both of the two simple events, $H$ and $T$ it is equal to 1).

2. Then we have:
- $\mathbb{E}[X] = \mathbb{E}[Y] = 1/2  \cdot 1 + 1/2 \cdot (-1) = 0$ from the definition of the maths expectation.
- $\mathbb{E}[XY] = 1$ because with $100\%$ probability the $XY$ is equal to 1.

# Example 5
If the input is this:
"# Here is the problem statement: 
A line of 100 hundred passengers are waiting to board on a plane. For convenience, let's say that $i$-th passenger has a ticket for place number $i$. Being drunk, the first person takes a seat at random. But all other 99 passengers are sober, so they will go to their proper seat unless it is already take. In that case, they will randomly choose a free seat. What is the probability that the person number 100 will get to his/her own seat?

# For which the correct solution(s) are: 
**Answer:** 50%.

**Solution 1**
1. Suppose whenever someone finds their seat taken, they politely evict the squatter and take their seat. In this case, the first passenger (let's call her Alice, who lost her boarding pass) keeps getting evicted (and choosing a new random seat) until, by the time everyone else has boarded, she has been forced by a process of elimination into her correct seat.
2. This process is the same as the original process except for the identities of the people in the seats, so the probability of the last boarder finding their seat occupied is the same.
3. When the last boarder boards, Alice is either in her own seat or in the last boarder's seat, which have both looked exactly the same (i.e. empty) to her up to now, so there is no way poor Alice could be more likely to choose one than the other.

**Solution 2**
1. Suppose that you are the person number 100. If the drunk passenger takes Nº1 by chance, then it's clear all the rest of the passengers will have the correct seats. If he takes Nº100, then you will not get your seat. The probabilities that he takes Nº1 or Nº100 are equal. 
2. Otherwise assume that he takes the $n$-th seat, where $n$ is a number between 2 and 99. Everyone between $2$ and $n-1$ will get their own seat. That means the $n$-th passenger essentially becomes the new ""drunk"" guy with designated seat Nº1. If he chooses Nº1, all the rest of the passengers will have the correct seats. If he takes Nº100, then you will not get your seat and the probabilities that he takes Nº1 or Nº100 are again equal.
3. Otherwise he will just make another passenger down the line the new ""drunk"" guy with designated seat Nº1 and each new ""drunk"" guy has equal probability of taking Nº1 or Nº100. Since at all jump points there's an equal probability for the ""drunk"" guy to choose seat Nº1 or Nº100, by symmetry, the probability that you, as the 100th passenger, will seat in Nº100 is 0.5. Hence the answer.

# And the Input Solution that I want you to do a sanity check for is: 
Potabally the person hundred will not gets their seat. The first drunk guy seat somewehre, anywheres random. Then the next person 2 will checks their seat. If its taken, they sit somewhere else. This keeps happenning, so at end, there might be only few seat lefts. So when the 100th passenger come in, it doesnt look like they get they proper seat most of the times. I think it like 10percent chance for him.

If the input is this:
"# Here is the problem statement: 
Paula shuffles a deck of cards thoroughly, then plays cards face up one at a time, from the top of the deck. At any time Victor can interrupt Paula and bet £1 that the next card will be red (if he never interrupts, he's automatically betting on the last card). What's Victor's best strategy? How much better than 50%-50% of winning can he do? Assume there are 26 red and 26 black cards in the deck.

# For which the correct solution(s) are: 
**Answer:** In fact it’s a fair game. Not only has Victor no way to earn an advantage, he has no way to lose one either: all strategies are equally effective and equally harmless.

**Explanation:** 
1. Suppose Victor has elected a strategy S, and let us apply S to a slightly modified version of “Next Card Red”. In the new version, Victor interrupts Paula as before, but this time he is betting not on the next card in the deck, but instead on the last card of the deck.
2. Of course, in any given position the last card has precisely the same probability of being red as the next card. Thus the strategy S has the same expected value in the new game as it did before.
3. But, of course, the astute reader will already have observed that the new version of “Next Card Red” is a pretty uninteresting game; Victor wins if the last card is red, regardless of his strategy.

# And the Input Solution that I want you to do a sanity check for is: 
The problem is about Victor making the best bet on the next card being red. Here’s the best strategy: 1. Victor can interrupt Paula and bet £1 that the next card will be red. 2. If Victor never interrupts, he's automatically betting on the last card. 3. Victor can’t actually gain an advantage, because the probability of the next card being red is always the same as the last card being red. \n4. No strategy can make the game unfair for Victor; he will always be at a 50-50 chance whether he bets on the next card or the last card. Soooo applying any strategy will not affect Victor’s probability of winning.

"# Here is the problem statement: 
If you pick a 9-digit number at random, what is the probability that its sum of digits will be even? (numbers do not start with zero)

# For which the correct solution(s) are: 
**Answer:** 1/2.

**Solution**
1. First, for the sake of practise, let's clearly define the probability model. For this problem, we should consider the model with $9 \cdot 10^8$ simple events corresponding to picking each of the 9-digits numbers. All of those simple events are going to have the same probability assigned to them.
2. Now, let's move on to answering the question. We will use a trick: let's split all of the simple events into groups of 10 based where only the last digit is different. So e.g numbers 123456780, 123456781, 123456782, ..., 123456789 are in the same group. 
3. Consider any of such groups, and let the sum of the first 8 digits in it be $S$ (all of the numbers in this group have the same first 8 digits, hence the $S$ is all the same for them). Then the sums of digits of the numbers in the group are $S+0, S+1, S+2, S+3, ..., S+9$. These are $10$ consecutive integers, so among them there are 5 odds one and there are 5 even ones, no matter what the value of $S$ is.
4. Thus, in each group exactly half of the simple events are the ones corresponding to picking a number such that its sum of digits is even (so ""favourable"" ones). Thus, exactly half of all the simple events are the favourable ones and so the probability we need to find is indeed 1/2.

# And the Input Solution that I want you to do a sanity check for is: 
There is a \(\frac{4}{9}\) probability that the left-most digit is even. For all the other 8 digits, there is \(\frac{1}{2}\) probability that a particular digit is even.

Thus, by principle of multiplication, the probability that the sum of digits will be even is:

\[\frac{4}{9}\times\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^8 = \frac{1}{9\cdot 2^6}\]

Thus, the answer is \(1/2\).

(E) 12.6

# For which the correct solution(s) are: 

1. We are given that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC = 3.6 \).
2. Point \( D \) is on \( AB \) such that \( AD = 1.2 \), and point \( E \) is on the extended line of \( AC \) such that \( \triangle ADE \)'s area equals the area of \( \triangle ABC \).

3. Let \( h \) be the altitude of \( \triangle ABC \) from \( C \) to \( AB \).
4. Since \( AD = 1.2 \) and \( AB = 3.6 \),
   \[
   AD = \frac{1}{3} AB
   \]
5. Construct perpendicular \( DK \) to \( AC \) at \( K \). Then,
   \[
   DK = \frac{1}{3} h
   \]
   since \( AD \) is \(\frac{1}{3} AB \).

6. To find \( AE \), we use the area condition given: \( S_{\triangle ADE} = S_{\triangle ABC} \).

7. The area of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
   \[
   S_{\triangle ABC} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot h = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3.6 \cdot h
   \]
8. Similarly, the area of \( \triangle ADE \) (noting that \( DK = \frac{1}{3} h \)) is:
   \[
   S_{\triangle ADE} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AE \cdot \frac{1}{3} h 
   \]

9. Since \( S_{\triangle ADE} = S_{\triangle ABC} \), we equate the two areas:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \cdot AE \cdot \frac{1}{3} h = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3.6 \cdot h
   \]
10. Simplifying this,
    \[
    \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3} AE \cdot h = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3.6 \cdot h
    \]
    \[
    \frac{AE}{3} = 3.6
    \]
    \[
    AE = 3 \cdot 3.6
    \]
    \[
    AE = 10.8
