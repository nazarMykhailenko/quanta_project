# Overview
Your task is to provide concise and useful feedback on the quality and clarity of the input solution while ignoring the technical correctness aspects. Note that this solution was most likely generated by a high schooler or a university student.

# Input
You will receive:
- Problem Statement
- One or more correct solutions to the problem
- Optional extra requirements to take into account when conducting a review
- Input Solution to evaluate
- Proofread and potentially clearer version of the Input Solution

# Output
# Instructions for Generating Feedback

Carefully review the entire prompt. Then generate feedback as a JSON dictionary addressing the following items:

1. Major_clarity_issues: Identify and describe any significant clarity issues in the explanation. These may include:
     - Contradictory claims: Instances where the solution asserts conflicting ideas or conclusions.
     - Lack of detail: Situations where a key claim is stated but not sufficiently justified, leaving gaps in logical reasoning.
     - Misleading language: Use of terms like "obvious/clear/easy" that oversimplify or misrepresent the complexity of the problem or solution.
     - Incomprehensible sections: Entire paragraphs or sentences that are vague or fail to fit logically into the context of the problem.
   Make sure to cite the specific part(s) of the Input Solution where these issues occur to provide clear examples. If no significant issues are present (minor unclarities do not count), output exactly 'None' for the 'Major_clarity_issues'.

2. Presentation_and_formatting: Evaluate the structure and readability of the solution, focusing on:
     - Step-by-step organization: Whether the solution is broken into manageable and logical steps, especially for longer or more complex problems.
     - Highlighting the answer: For problems requiring a final answer (as opposed to purely proof-based problems), check if the answer is distinctly stated at the beginning or end for clarity.
     - Formatting: Are LaTeX formulas legible and is the general formatting adequate for easy reading? The solution does not need to be visually perfect, but it should not hinder understanding.

3. Quality_of_Submission_Good_Aspects: Summarize the positive aspects of the clarity & conciseness of the submission, in particular comment on the following:
     - Clear sections: Highlight parts of the solution that are particularly well-explained, logically structured, or insightful.
     - Conciseness: Mention if the explanations are succinct without sacrificing clarity.
     - Effective communication: Recognize any stylistic strengths, such as an intuitive flow of ideas or precise language that aids comprehension.

4. Quality_Grade: Carefully process your feedback you just created together with the Input Solution one more time, and output the grade based on the following rubric:
    - A: The submission is well-structured, clear, and includes all necessary explanations and steps. There could be some grammar mistakes, small typos or LaTeX-related errors, it does not matter.
    - B: Explanations are fine, structure is somewhat clear, but some small steps may be omitted and/or presentation is not good. It is basically grade A, but with one or a few not-too-significant errors/issues with the presentation and clarity.
    - E: The input solution is overall not great, many explanations are lacking or English quality is not great. However, there is something that looks like a decent attempt at structuring and/or formatting the solution well.
    - F: The submission is poorly presented, lacking explanations, or English quality is terrible making solution hard to follow. Even if there is a good idea in the solution, but the presentation quality is terrible, it should be an F.
