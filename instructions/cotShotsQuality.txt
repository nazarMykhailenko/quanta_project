# Example 1

If the Input is this:

# Here is the problem statement: 
A two-digit number is picked at random (numbers do not start with zero). Find the probability that this number has no zeros in its decimal representation.

# For which the correct solution(s) are: 
**Answer:** $81/90 = 9/10$.

**Solution:** 
1. We will consider the following probability model:
- Simple Events: Those are all possible two-digit numbers. There are 90 of them, you can either list them (but it will take a while) or note that there are 10 that start with 1, 10 that start with 2, ..., 10 that start with 9, hence there are $9 \cdot 10 = 90$ of them in total.
- Probabilities: Each of the simple events will get the same probability assigned (again, this is our choice, it is just it is reasonable given how the question is formulated), hence each of them will get the number $1/90$ assigned as its probability.

2. Now, let's move on to answering the question of the problem about finding the probability of the event ""picked number has not zeros in its decimal representation"". We could, of course, list all of them, but there are quite many of such numbers... Instead, let's count the number of simple events that are **not** of our interest; it is much easier! Indeed, the two-digit number that has a zero is one of the following: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, i.e it is just 9 simple events! Hence the number of simple events that **are** of our interest is $90-9=81$. Therefore, the answer is (by the definition) $1/90 + 1/90 + ... + 1/90$ summed 81 times, i.e it is $81/90 = 9/10$.

# The Input Solution that I want you to give me feedback for is: 
Answer: $81/90 = 9/10$.

Solution:
1. We will use this probability model:
 1.1 Simple Events: These are all possible two-digit numbers. There are 90 of them. You can list them (which would take time) or note that there are 10 numbers that start with 1, 10 that start with 2, ..., and 10 that start with 9, making a total of $9 \cdot 10 = 90$.
  1.2 Probabilities: Each of the simple events will have the same probability (reasonable given the question), so each has a probability of $1/90$.

Now, let's find the probability that the number picked has no zeros in its decimal representation. The numbers that have at least one zero are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90, which are 9 simple events that are not of our interest. So, the number of simple events that **are** of our interest is $90-9=81$. Therefore, the probability is $1/90 + 1/90 + ... + 1/90$ summed 81 times, which is $81/90 = 9/10$.
